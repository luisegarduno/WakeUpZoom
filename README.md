- Desktop shortcut is created so you DON'T have to keep up with URL's.
- As long as you're logged in, Zoom meetings will deploy automatically as scheduled.
- Schedule as many Zoom meetings as you want!
- Stayed up late & only need to use it once? You can specify the frequency (Once/Weekly)
- PowerShell can be closed as soon as classes have been added!
- Program only needs to be ran ONCE (if scheduling for weekly meetings)
